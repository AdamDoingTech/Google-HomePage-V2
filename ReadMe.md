-- Hello, this is Adam from Atom Lab X 👨🏾‍💻

Project Overview: 
* The <a href="https://atomlabx.github.io/Google-HomePage-V2/" target="_blank">Live Preview</a> For the Project.
* This is a learning project I'm working on while doing The Odin Project.
* I want to showcase my work while working on this project for myself. 
* This is a puplic project.

Why I'm creating the project once more?
* Because I can do a better job, if I take my time with the project, and make it look better than the first version, and that was the case at the very end of the project.  

Why not update the first version then?
* Because I want to compare between the two and learn from the experience overall. 

What Did I Learn So Far? 
* You can use (text-align) on images as well!
* You can use (text-align) on "div's" as well!
* I can do better job, if I put my mind into it!

Contribution Guidelines:
* Allowed to Be Forked, Edited, Etc...
* Feedback Is Welcome.


C Ya on the other side! 👋🏾
