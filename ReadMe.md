-- Hello, this is Adam from Atom Lab X 👨🏾‍💻

Project Overview: 
* This is a learning project I'm working on while doing the Odin Project.
* I want to showcase my work while working on this project for myself. 
* This is a puplic project.

Why I'm creating the project again?
* I think I can do a better job than the first version, and I want to take my time making the second version and won't rush through it, like how I did with the first version. 

Why not update the first version then?
* Because I want to compare between the two and learn from the expirince overall. 

What did I learn So Far? 
* You can use (text-align) on images as well!
* You can use (text-align) on "div's" as well!

Contribution Guidelines:
* Allowed to Forked, Edited.
* Feedback Is Welcome.


C Ya on the other side! 👋🏾
